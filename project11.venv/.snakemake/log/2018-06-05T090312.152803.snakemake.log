Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	final
	1	get_genes
	1	get_ids
	3

rule get_ids:
    input: ../Blok11/data/RNA-Seq-counts.txt
    output: ID.csv
    jobid: 1

Finished job 1.
1 of 3 steps (33%) done

rule get_genes:
    input: ID.csv
    output: sequences.fasta
    jobid: 2

Finished job 2.
2 of 3 steps (67%) done

localrule final:
    input: ID.csv, sequences.fasta
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
