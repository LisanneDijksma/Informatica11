Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	final
	1	get_genes
	1	get_ids
	1	get_pubmed_ids
	4

rule get_ids:
    input: ../Blok11/data/RNA-Seq-counts.txt
    output: ID.csv
    jobid: 3

Finished job 3.
1 of 4 steps (25%) done

rule get_pubmed_ids:
    input: ID.csv
    output: pubmedids.csv
    jobid: 2

Finished job 2.
2 of 4 steps (50%) done

rule get_genes:
    input: ID.csv
    output: sequences.fasta
    jobid: 1

Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
