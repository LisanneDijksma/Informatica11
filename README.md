This code generates an HTML table based from a CSV file. This is from the [tutorial][source] by **Christophe Viau**.

In trying his code example, I discovered that the code doesn't work as-is, so I figured others might like to see a working d3.js example that did not rely on a pre-existing container HTML element.

The code remains the same except for some cosmetic tweaks.

The task of writing the CSS is left as an exercise for the reader.
